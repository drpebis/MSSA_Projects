This is a procedurally generated C# console app in which the player can:

-Travel to and from procedurally generated planets!
-Buy/Sell goods in order to become a master merchant!
-Try not to run out of fuel and be stranded in the cold, dead of space!


Player Objective:
-Travel to as many planets as possible, buying and selling items for profit.

Tips:
-Different ships have different fuel/caro ratios (try them out)
-The more fuel you have, the more planets you will be able to visit. 
-Different planets are in different solar sytems, which will affect prices of items...
